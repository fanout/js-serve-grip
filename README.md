## js-serve-grip

GRIP library for Node.js, provided as `connect`-compatible middleware.

Therefore, this library is usable with frameworks such as the following:

* [connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/Connect)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Koa](https://koajs.org/) * experimental support

Supported GRIP servers include:

* [Pushpin](http://pushpin.org/)
* [Fanout Cloud](https://fanout.io/cloud/)

Authors: Katsuyuki Omuro <komuro@fastly.com>, Konstantin Bokarius <kon@fanout.io>

### Introduction

[GRIP](https://pushpin.org/docs/protocols/grip/) is a protocol that enables a web service to
delegate realtime push behavior to a proxy component, using HTTP and headers.

`@fanoutio/serve-grip` parses the `Grip-Sig` header in any requests to detect if they came through a Grip
proxy, and provides your route handler with tools to handle such requests.  This includes
access to information about whether the current request is proxied or is signed, as well as
methods to issue any hold instructions to the GRIP proxy.

Additionally, `serve-grip` also handles
[WebSocket-Over-HTTP processing](https://pushpin.org/docs/protocols/websocket-over-http/) so
that WebSocket connections managed by the GRIP proxy can be controlled by your route handlers.

### Installation

Install the library.

```sh
npm install @fanoutio/serve-grip
```

#### Installation in Connect / Express

Import the `ServeGrip` class and instantiate the middleware. Then install it before your routes.

Example:
```javascript
const express = require( 'express' );
const { ServeGrip } = require( '@fanoutio/serve-grip' );

const app = express();

const serveGrip = new ServeGrip(/* config */);
app.use( serveGrip ); 

app.use( '/path', (res, req) => {

    if (req.grip.isProxied) {
        const gripInstruct = res.grip.startInstruct();
        gripInstruct.addChannel('test');
        gripInstruct.setHoldStream();
        res.end('[stream open]\n');
    }

});

app.listen(3000);
```

#### Installation in Koa (experimental)

Import the `ServeGrip` class and instantiate it. The Koa middleware is available
as the `.koa` property on the object. Install it before your routes.

Example:
```javascript
const Koa = require( 'koa' );
const Router = require( '@koa/router' );
const { ServeGrip } = require( '@fanoutio/serve-grip' );

const app = new Koa();

const serveGrip = new ServeGrip(/* config */);
app.use( serveGrip.koa );

const router = new Router();

router.use( '/path', ctx => {

    if (ctx.req.grip.isProxied) {
        const gripInstruct = res.grip.startInstruct();
        gripInstruct.addChannel('test');
        gripInstruct.setHoldStream();
        ctx.body = '[stream open]\n';
    }

});

app.use(router.routes())
    .use(router.allowedMethods());

app.listen(3000);
```

#### Installation in Next.js

You may use this library to add GRIP functionality to your
[Next.js API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

Import the `ServeGrip` class and instantiate the middleware, and then run it in your handler
before your application logic by calling the async function `serveGrip.run()`.

Example:
`/lib/grip.js`:
```javascript
import { ServeGrip } from '@fanoutio/serve-grip';
export const serveGrip = new ServeGrip(/* config */);
```

`/pages/api/path.js`:
```javascript
import { serveGrip } from '/lib/grip';

export default async(req, res) => {
    // Run the middleware
    if (!(await serveGrip.run(req, res))) {
        // If serveGrip.run() has returned false, it means the middleware has already
        // sent and ended the response, usually due to an error.  
        return;
    }

    if (req.grip.isProxied) {
        const gripInstruct = res.grip.startInstruct();
        gripInstruct.addChannel('test');
        gripInstruct.setHoldStream();
        res.end('[stream open]\n');
    }

}
```

Note: In Next.js, you must specifically call the middleware from each of your applicable API routes.
This is because in Next.js, your API routes will typically run on a serverless platform, and objects
will be recycled after each request. You are advised to construct a singleton instance of the
middleware in a shared location and reference it from your API routes.  

### Configuration

`@fanoutio/serve-grip` exports a constructor function, `ServeGrip`.  This constructor takes a
configuration object that can be used to configure the instance, such as the GRIP proxies to use
for publishing or whether incoming requests should require a GRIP proxy.

```javascript
import { ServeGrip } from '@fanoutio/serve-grip';
const serveGrip = new ServeGrip({
    grip: {
        control_uri: 'https://api.fanout.io/realm/<realm-name>/publish/', // Publishing endpoint
        control_iss: '<realm-name>', // (optional) Needed for servers that require authorization
        key: '<realm-key>',          // (optinoal) Needed for servers that require authorization
    },
    isGripProxyRequired: true,
});
```

Available options:
| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `grip` | A definition of GRIP proxies used to publish messages, or a preconfigured Publisher object from `@fanoutio/grip`. See below for details. |
| `gripProxyRequired` | A boolean value representing whether all incoming requests should require that they be called behind a GRIP proxy.  If this is true and a GRIP proxy is not detected, then a `501 Not Implemented` error will be issued. Defaults to `false`. |
| `prefix` | An optional string that will be prepended to the name of channels being published to. This can be used for namespacing. Defaults to `''`. |

In most cases your application will construct a singleton instance of this class and use it as
the middleware.

The `grip` parameter may be provided as any of the following:

1. An object with the following fields:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `control_uri` | Publishing endpoint for the GRIP proxy. |
| `control_iss` | A claim string that is needed for servers that require authorization. For Fanout Cloud, this is the Realm ID. |
| `key` | A key string that is needed for servers that require authorization. For Fanout Cloud, this is the Realm Key. |

2. An array of such objects.

3. A GRIP URI, which is a string that encodes the above as a single string.

4. A `Publisher` object that you have instantiated and configrued yourself, from `@fanoutio/grip`.

### Handling a route

After the middleware has run, your handler will receive `req` and `res` objects that have been
extended with `grip` properties.  These provide access to the following:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `req.grip.isProxied` | A boolean value indicating whether the current request has been called via a GRIP proxy. |
| `req.grip.isSigned` | A boolean value indicating whether the current request is a signed request called via a GRIP proxy. |
| `req.grip.wsContext` | If the current request has been made through WebSocket-Over-HTTP, then a `WebSocketContext` object for the current request. See `@fanoutio/grip` for details on `WebSocketContext`. |

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `res.grip.startInstruct()` | Returns an instance of `GripInstruct`, which can be used to issue instructions to the GRIP proxy to hold connections. See `@fanoutio/grip` for details on `GripInstruct`. |

To publish messages, call `serveGrip.getPublisher()` to obtain a
`Publisher`. Use it to publish messages using the endpoints and 
prefix specified to the `ServeGrip` constructor.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `serveGrip.getPublisher()` | Returns an instance of `Publisher`, which can be used to publish messages to the provided publishing endpoints using the provided prefix. See `@fanoutio/grip` for details on `Publisher`. |

### Examples

This repository contains examples to illustrate the use of `serve-grip` in Connect / Express
and Next.js, which can be found in the `examples` directory.  For details on each example, please
read the `README.md` files in the corresponding directories.  

### Advanced

#### Next.js alternative invocation

As an alternative method of running `serveGrip` in a Next.js API route, since `serveGrip` is
`connect`-compatible, you may use the process described in
[API Middlewares](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/api-middlewares#connectexpress-middleware-support).
This may be useful for example if you have multiple middlewares and you wish to call them in a
uniform manner.

Example:
`/lib/grip.js`:
```javascript
import { ServeGrip } from '@fanoutio/serve-grip';
export const serveGrip = new ServeGrip(/* config */);

// Helper method to wait for a middleware to execute before continuing
// And to throw an error when an error happens in a middleware
// https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/api-middlewares#connectexpress-middleware-support
export function runMiddleware(req, res, fn) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fn(req, res, (result) => {
            if (result instanceof Error) {
                return reject(result)
            }

            return resolve(result)
        })
    })
}
```

`/pages/api/path.js`:
```javascript
import { serveGrip, runMiddleware } from '/lib/grip';

export default async(req, res) => {

    // Run the middleware
    await runMiddleware(req, res, serveGrip);

    if (req.grip.isProxied) {
        const gripInstruct = res.grip.startInstruct();
        gripInstruct.addChannel('test');
        gripInstruct.setHoldStream();
        res.end('[stream open]\n');
    }

}
```

#### Changes from `express-grip`

If you have used `express-grip` in the past, you will notice that this library no longer
requires the use of pre-route and post-route middlewares.  Consequently, you do not need to
call `next()` for route handlers that complete their work.  In fact, you should follow the
standard practice of calling `res.end()` at the end of each of your route handlers.
